# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Purpose
I have leanred to use jQuery and Monment.js to build this scheduler. I had issues in storing local data, and retrieving data from local storage as well. It was still hard for me. I need to do more practice with it.

## Build With
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Moment.js
